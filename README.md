# exPENsion
## Idea
One player starts with a scribble, another makes a drawing out of it.
Further explanation of this idea can be found here: https://playcuriously.wordpress.com/scribble-art/ (though I didn't learn about the idea from there)
Name is a combination of "pen" and "extension"/"expansion" (players draw with virtual **pens** and the one player **expands** on the other player's scribble).
## Disused Names
- eiDRAWtic (draw/eidetic; based on a Quora post I skimmed via the Google preview and as such misunderstood: https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-call-a-person-who-is-always-finishing-another-s-sentences)
- exPENned (same idea as current, problem is it sounds the exact same as "expend")
