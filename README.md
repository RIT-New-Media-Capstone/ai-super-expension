# AI Super exPENsion
## Idea
A game played by 2 human players and 1 AI player. First, one human player starts with a scribble. Then, the other makes a drawing out of it following a text prompt. Finally, an image-generative AI is fed that same prompt and drawing to make a fully-fledged image.
Based off the original exPENsion (https://github.com/dr-cooder/expension), this game puts a modern technology twist on a classic creative exercise (https://playcuriously.wordpress.com/scribble-art/).
